# AI-Heyjack
The AI personal receptionist, Heyjack.

Hijack is an almost completely self hosted AI to answer questions you may have in your everyday life.
It only sends the output to google to be converted to voice to be played on your machine. It can run without internet, but some commands require internet, like the weather. These are API based and get public data without sharing yours. Since you run it and it's open source it will always be free.
